// lets talk about inline events in javascript .
// there are three ways to respond to user events .
// the one way is adding inline events in javascirpt .

// HTML
<button onCLick = "alert = ('Stop clicking .........') ; alert('You mother fucker stop clikcing the button....')">Click meee</button>

// its kind of annoyiing juncky and feels bezar to code and handle.
// inline HTML events are not used in the current era so for learing and starting work with events its great but for day to day use its just trash.
